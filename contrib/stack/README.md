## Stack Processors

Read the document for each stack processor for details.

### Installation

To use the TOPS or Stripmap stack processors you need to:

1. Install ISCE as usual

2. Depending on which stack processor you need to try, add the path of the folder containing the python scripts to your **$PATH** environment variable as follows:
   - add the full path of your **contrib/stack/topsStack** to $PATH to use the topsStack for processing a stack of Sentinel-1 tops data
   - add the full path of your **contrib/stack/stripmapStack** to $PATH to use the stripmapStack for processing a stack of Stripmap data

Note: The stack processors do not show up in the install directory of your isce software. They can be found in the isce source directory. 

#### Important Note: ####

There might be conflicts between topsStack and stripmapStack scripts (due to comman names of different scripts). Therefore users **MUST only** have the path of **one stack processor in their $PATH environment at a time**, to avoid conflicts between the two stack processors.
